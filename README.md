# AV-EDR-bypass-payloads
is a collection of custom-built payloads designed to bypass modern Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. This project focuses on multiple payload formats and evasion techniques to support advanced red team operations, adversary simulations, and penetration testing.

Features

    Multiple payload types: EXE, DLL, Shellcode, Powershell, HTA, ISO containers, and more

    AV and EDR evasion techniques including:

        Obfuscation

        Encryption

        Runtime compilation

        API unhooking

        In-memory execution

    Modular structure for easy addition of new payloads

    Focused on stealth, flexibility, and OPSEC
